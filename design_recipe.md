## 1. Describe the Problem

# Bowling Scorecard Challenge

### Count and sum the scores of a bowling game of one player

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down 10 pins. In every frame the player can throw one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

#### Strikes

The player has a strike if she knocks down all 10 pins with the first roll in a frame. The frame ends immediately (since there are no pins left for a second roll). The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the _next two rolls._ That is the next frame, except if the player rolls a strike again.

#### Spares

The player has a spare if she knocks down all 10 pins with the two roles of a frame. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first role of next frame).

#### 10th frame

If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame she can roll the additional balls for the bonus. But she can never roll more than 3 balls in the 10th frame. The additional rolls only count for the bonus- not for the regular frame count.

10, 10, 10 in the 10th frame gives 30 points (10 points for the regular first strike and 20 points for the bonus)
1, 9, 10 in the 10th frame gives 20 points (10 points for the regular spare and 10 points for the bonus)
Gutter Game

A Gutter Game is when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores).

#### Perfect Game

A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores to 300 points.

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ MusicPlayer                │
│                            │
│ - tracks                   │
│ - add(track)               │
│ - search_by_title(keyword) │
│   => [tracks...]           │
└───────────┬────────────────┘
            │
            │ owns a list of
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Track(title, artist)    │
│                         │
│ - title                 │
│ - artist                │
│ - format()              │
│   => "TITLE by ARTIST"  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```python
class MusicLibrary:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   tracks: list of instances of Track

    def __init__(self):
        pass # No code here yet

    def add(self, track):
        # Parameters:
        #   track: an instance of Track
        # Side-effects:
        #   Adds the track to the tracks property of the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def search_by_title(self, keyword):
        # Parameters:
        #   keyword: string
        # Returns:
        #   A list of the Track objects that have titles that include the keyword
        pass # No code here yet


class Track:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   title: string
    #   artist: string

    def __init__(self, title, artist):
        # Parameters:
        #   title: string
        #   artist: string
        # Side-effects:
        #   Sets the title and artist properties
        pass # No code here yet

    def format(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A string of the form "TITLE by ARTIST"
        pass # No code here yet

```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a library
When we add two tracks
We see those tracks reflected in the tracks list
"""
library = MusicLibrary()
track_1 = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.tracks # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a track with a title and an artist
We see the title reflected in the title property
"""
track = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
